                <h2>Activities of Taniti</h2>
                <p>
                    Most people visit Taniti to enjoy the beaches, explore the rainforest, and to visit 
                    the volcano. However, there are other things to do, including visiting a local history 
                    museum, going on chartered fishing tours, snorkeling, zip-lining in the rainforest, 
                    visiting several pubs, including a microbrewery, dancing at a new dance club, seeing 
                    a movie, taking helicopter rides, playing at an arcade, visiting art galleries, and 
                    bowling. Also, a nine-hole golf course should be operational by next year. Many of 
                    these activities are located in Merriton Landing, which is a rapidly developing area 
                    on the north side of Yellow Leaf Bay.

                        <p>
                            Most tourists spend most of their time in Taniti City, which boasts native architecture 
                            and nearby white, sandy beaches that encircle Yellow Leaf Bay. Other popular activities 
                            include boat or bus tours of the island, hikes in the rainforest, or visits to Taniti's active volcano.

                Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island has an area of less than
                500 square miles, the terrain is varied and includes both sandy and rocky beaches, a small but 
                safe harbor, lush tropical rainforests, and a mountainous interior that includes a small, 
                active volcano. Taniti has an indigenous population of about 20,000. Until a recent increase 
                in tourism, most the Tanitian economy was dominated by fishing or agriculture.
