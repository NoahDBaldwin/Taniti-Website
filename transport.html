                <h2>Traveling to Taniti</h2>
                <p>
                    Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though some arrive on a small 
                    cruise ship that docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for one night per week. Taniti is 
                    served by a small airport that can accommodate small jets and propeller planes. 
                    Taniti is in the process of expanding the airport so larger jets will be able 
                    to land on the island within the next few years.

                            Once a week, cruise Taniti arrives at the Yellow Leaf Bay.
                            Come join us for a few glorious days on the sea. Onboard dining, 
                            casinos, and shopping are available. We offer different types of 
                            accomodations from our affordable twin rooms to our large suites.

                            Taniti has its very own airport. Currently smaller planes can land here,
                            but soon we will be able to accomodate larger planes. From here you can
                            fly to and from nearby islands as well as to the mainland. We host multiple
                            airlines to best suite your needs. Feel free to book your trip today.

                <h2>Local Transportation</h2>
                <p>
                    Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day. Private 
                    buses serve the rest of the island. Taxis are available in Taniti City, and rental 
                    cars can be rented from a local rental agency near the airport. Bikes and helmets 
                    are available to rent from several vendors (helmets are required by law). Taniti City 
                    is fairly flat and very walkable. Many tourists stay in the area surrounding Merriton 
                    Landing: this area is easy to explore on foot.

                Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island has an area of less than
                500 square miles, the terrain is varied and includes both sandy and rocky beaches, a small but 
                safe harbor, lush tropical rainforests, and a mountainous interior that includes a small, 
                active volcano. Taniti has an indigenous population of about 20,000. Until a recent increase 
                in tourism, most the Tanitian economy was dominated by fishing or agriculture.
